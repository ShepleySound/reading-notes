## JavaScript Canvas

1. What does the `<canvas>` allow a developer to acheive?  
`<canvas>` allows developers to draw 2D graphics using JavaScript.
2. What is the importance of the closing `</canvas>` tag?  
The closing tag allows content to be placed inside the element, which will be used as fallback content in case the browser does not support `<canvas>`.
3. Explain what the `getContext()` method does.  
The method returns a rendering context, which provides an object for JavaScript to draw onto. In the case of the `'2d'` argument, it allows JavaScript to draw 2-dimensional shapes, text, and images.

## Easily Create Stunning Animated Charts with Chart.js

1. What are some advantages to displaying data via a chart over a table?  
A chart built with Chart.js is more eye-pleasing out-of-the-box than an HTML table, and is more customizable. The data can be manipulated and displayed in ways that can increase the user's understanding of the data.
2. How could Chart.js aid your previously created applications visually?  
Chart.js could aid the SalmonCookies project in many ways. For example, the "Staff Required Per Hour" table could benefit from a line chart, or even a bar chart. Both charts are time-based, and the data could better be interpreted without having to look at the numbers themselves.
