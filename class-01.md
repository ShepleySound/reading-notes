## Getting Started
1. Compose a short poem describing how HTTP sends data between computers. <br> *Haiku*<br> A client requests <br> The server gives permission <br> Files are now served
2. Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser. <br> The browser goes through the retrieved HTML file, and grabs references to any CSS and JS files using \<link> or \<script> tags. The browser makes sense of HTML and CSS files by building DOM trees and CSSOM structures, and executes the provided JavaScript. 
3. How can you find images to add to a Website? <br> Saving files from Google Images works, provided it does not violate copyright. I've found a lot of great images on Unsplash.com!
4. How do you create a `String` vs a `Number` in JavaScript? <br> Wrapping a variable in quotations will create a String. Declaring a number without quotations will result in a Number.<br>String - `let x = '10'`<br> Number - `let x = 10`
5. What is a Variable and why are they important in JavaScript?<br> Variables allow us to store data or values for later use.
