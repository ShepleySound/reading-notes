These notes offer a review of my understanding of NodeJS, Express, and NPM so far. They will also go over two concepts that are relatively new to me: TDD and CI/CD.

## [An introduction to NodeJS and Express](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction)

1. Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter.

2. Express the most popular ________.

3. Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?
"Unopinionated" is a way of describing tools and frameworks that are designed in such a way that there is no *single* "correct" way of doing things. By contrast, an opinionated framework is one that is designed with a certain way of performing tasks in mind. It will favor certain design patterns and using anything outside of those design patterns may come with unnecessary friction. By using an unopinionated framework, a developer is more free to use the design patterns that fit their personal problem set or workflow.

4. What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?

## [What is NPM?](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm)

1. What version of npm are you running on your machine?

2. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project?

## [What is TDD?](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/tdd/)

1. Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder.

2. What are three expected benefits of testing

3. Name at lest 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests.

## [CI/CD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSv_m3KhUO8)

1. What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?

2. What is the difference between Continuos Delivery and Continuous Deployment?

3. Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background.
