# The Growth Mindset

## Bias
While ridding ourselves of bias completely is impossible, recognizing our own biases and reorienting both our actions and our mindsets is possible. While identity and cultural biases and how they change our interactions with others are important topics to consider, it is also important to think about our level of empathy, curiosity, and courage.

## Deliberate Practice
While learning software development, it's easy to get caught in a loop of rehashing basic tasks and building things that lay well within our comfort zones. It's important to recognize that, despite all of the new things one may have learned, there's *always* something new knowledge to gather. This is where deliberate practice comes in. As the saying goes, "You don't know what you don't know", and often the best way to discover the gaps in our knowledge is to pick a path that feels uncomfortable or uncharted and find ways to learn more about it.
