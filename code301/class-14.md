## Consider the history: That Time When Women Stopped Coding

1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?  
The rise of personal computers in homes. One theory is that, as computers became more of a commodity, their function as a "toy" was emphasized and marketed to boys. This helped to further a "geek culture" that primarily included males.

2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?  
There's an idea that the only people that "belong" in tech are people that have been toying around with computers since they were young. The early marketing of computers to boys created a propensity for more men to go into tech than women, and furthermore helped to entrench the gatekeeping mentality in tech.

## Ask the question: Why diversity matters to your tech company

1. When are diversity efforts most successful?  
Diversity efforts work best when they are driven by real commitment from company leaders. There's definitely a need for buy-in from people who aren't leaders in a company, but without that top-down commitment, not much can get done.

2. Why do diverse companies perform better?  
Diverse companies have direct contributors with a wider scope of ideas and experiences. It helps to drive innovation and creativity.

3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.  
A diverse company will have people who can more easily relate to a diverse user base, and a diverse user base will be able to relay a wider array of suggestions to the company whose products they use. With more diversity, more ideas are thrown together and iterated from.
