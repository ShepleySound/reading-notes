# Class 01
This reading introduces foundational concepts about React that are vital to understanding its purpose and how it functions.

## Component-Based Architecture 
1. What is a “component”?  
A component is a piece of an overall design.  
2. What are the characteristics of a component?  
A component is modular and reusable. It is a part of a larger picture destructured into a smaller logical or functional piece.  
3. What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?    
Components can be reused and manipulated, and they hold the behavior of an element. The advantages include a faster development process and the reliability that comes with the reuse of a tried-and-true component.  

## Props and How to Use it in React
1. What is “props” short for?  
Properties!  
2. How are props used in React?  
Props are used to pass data from one component to another.  
3. What is the flow of props?  
Props flow from parent to child. They typically should not/cannot flow from child to parent.  

## Things I want to know more about
- Class Components vs. Function Components w/ Hooks! I've already looked into this quite a bit, but I don't think I'll fully understand the advantages of either until I've actually had hands-on experience with both of them.
